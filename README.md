# Next Steps

- Guest feature: adding my original idea of adding an RSVP feature to that users can RSVP to certain events.
- Pages to event details: I'd like to adjust the view of the "All Events" page to only be able to view the name of the event along with the user who created it. I would add a feature to 'click' on the Event to be able to see the event details and the guests with a specific event code so only certain people can see that event.
- A search bar: A search bar to allow users to look for certain events by name or by the creator's user name.
